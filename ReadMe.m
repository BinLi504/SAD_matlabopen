% The folder "SADdemo" contains the codes for the following four
% sub-folders:

% Core_files: contains the implementation of the SAD algorithm

% Sample_test: contains one example on how to use the SAD
% algorithm with the least square method to process data in batches. 

% Dataset: contains the signals tested in the paper referenced below 

% otherAlgorithms: contains the ASimCo, ASPADE and ConstDL angorithms.

% Our codes run in Matlab R2019b (9.7.0.1190202 (R2019b)), and use the toolbox of Neural Network, 
% Communications, Audio and Optimization and Signal Processing.
